.. image:: ../../images/bzLifecycle.png

This picture shows the lifecycle of a bug through its different statuses and
resolutions. This picture is included in the documentation. It was generated
using `Dia <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia>`_.

To localize it, open the file :file:`docs/ab-CD/images/bzLifecycle.xml` with
``Dia``, localize it and export it as a .png file by selecting the
:guilabel:`Pixbuf[png] (*.png)` filter in the dropdown. You need to save it as
:file:`docs/ab-CD/images/bzLifecycle.png`.
